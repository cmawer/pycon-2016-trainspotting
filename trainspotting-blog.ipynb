Therefore, to reduce noise in each frame, we apply a [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur), which replaces each pixel's value with a weighted average of it and the surrounding pixels.

In OpenCV's `GaussianBlur` function, we define the size of the neighborhood in the *x* and *y* direction that we want to include in the calculation of each pixel. This size provides control over the computational effort required for the blur. We can then define the $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ ourselves or simply input `0`, which results in OpenCV calculating $\\sigma$ based on the kernel size and a heuristic found to be effective in the literature.
