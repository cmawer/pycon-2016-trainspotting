    "Here at Silicon Valley Data Science, we have a slight obsession with the Caltrain. At our last office, we were in an old building directly next door to the Sunnyvale Caltrain station. Everytime a Caltrain passed, the horns blew and we would have to pause whatever we were doing. Now we are just as close to the Mountain View station but are continually thankful for soundproof windows and walls. A quarter of the company relies on the Caltrain to get to work each day and the game of \"when will I get to work today?\" has become an office favorite; we even have a Slack channel devoted to it. It has thus only been fitting that we use the Caltrain as a guinea pig for one of our R&D projects, which we use as a channel for exploring new technologies, comparing known ones, experimenting with new algorithms, and stress-testing hypotheses and ideas. You can currently find \"Caltrain Rider\" in both the Android and Apple app stores, which has the most well-engineered backend involving **[Add stuff here... Kafka queues and HBase storage. We have Spark streaming jobs continually ingesting Caltrain twitter data and analyzing it for sentiment.]**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever ridden the train, you will know that those delay estimates Caltrain provides are seemingly random. Often a train will remain \"two minutes delayed\" for ten minutes or longer after the train was *already* meant to have departed. Or, delays will be reported and the train will be completely on time. We have thus been working on the bigger analytical problem of how we can better predict train delays. The main input for the analysis has been data scraped from the Caltrain website (they are okay with this!). The data itself is not actually information on when a train has arrived at or left a station, but the often wrong, on-time predictions for the train, updated each minute. We interpreted that when there is no longer an on-time prediction for a train that it has actually left the station but wanted some ground truth data to support this interpretation. Taking advantage of our location next to the Caltrain tracks, we decided to point a camera at the tracks in order to visually detect when a train is passing and in what direction it is going to provide such a data point. Through this task, we learned the ease with which one can develop a motion detection algorithm, which I will share with you in this blog post. Moreover, it has also given us the chance to experiment with Raspberry Pis and with deploying and monitoring the beginnings of our own 'internet of things'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Following along\n",
    "In this blog post, I will walk through the basics of the algorithm we developed to identify a train's passing and direction via video. At SVDS, we are a big proponent of [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) as they provide an effective method for interactively performing, documenting, visualizing, and communicating analysis as it is done. Therefore, this blog post is indeed a Jupyter Notebook and the .ipynb version can be downloaded **here** so that you can do some motion detection of your own. A helper file, `trainspotting.py`, of functions for loading different video feeds (including your own computer camera) and performing much of this analysis can also be found in the repository. \n",

However, in this case, the non-window sections of the train don't change in pixel value significantly, making the only movement that is tracked that of the windows. There are so many windows all of the same size passing by at such a very fast speed that it is difficult to track single windows entirely across the frame to detect direction of movement. \n",
